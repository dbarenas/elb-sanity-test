elb-sanity-test
===============

Are my AWS Elastic Load Balancers set up properly?
A test you can run to check your ELB for common gotchas.
See http://shlomoswidler.com/2009/09/solving-common-elb-problems-with-sanity.html

The original code from Google Code is here in GitHub as branch "0.1".

The "master" branch is currently a work-in-progress, rewriting it in Ruby and
updating the tests for some of the technology changes that AWS ELB has
undergone in the past four years.
